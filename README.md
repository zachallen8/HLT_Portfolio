 Portfolio repo for human language technologies.
 

###  Portfolio Assignment 0: Getting Started
* [Here](https://github.com/zachallen8/HLT_Portfolio/blob/3f48b29eb8f4f55aabb8fdd39cb1255ccc601f0d/Overview%20of%20NLP.pdf) is the pdf to the assignment, titled "Overview of NLP".

### Portfolio Assignment 1: Text Processing with Python
* [Here](https://github.com/zachallen8/HLT_Portfolio/blob/main/HW1/HW1_zma180000.py) is the python file to the assignment
* The program reads in a .csv file with employee data, formatting the names of the employees, and validating ID/phone number information with the user. It then outputs all the correctly formatted employee data.
* The program is run with the command "python3 HW1_zma180000.py data/data.csv", as the .csv file is needed as a sysarg. The user will then be prompted for input on the command line for incorrect data found within the file
* Some strengths regarding text processing in python are the ease of checking data formatting through built in features such as the re library, and how easy it is to get direct input from the user and store it into variables on the fly. A weaknesses is the difficulty of breaking down the file for input in comparison to other languages such as Java with it's Scanner library.
* I learned about data formatting through regular expressions and file input in this assignment. 

### Portfolio Assignment 2: Exploring NLTK
* [Here](https://github.com/zachallen8/HLT_Portfolio/blob/main/Portfolio%20Assignment%202/zma180000-portfolio-assignment-3.pdf) is the .pdf for the Jupyter Notebook for the assignment.

### Portfolio Assignment 3: Guessing Game
* [Here](https://github.com/zachallen8/HLT_Portfolio/blob/main/Portfolio%20Assignment%203/HW3_zma180000.py) is the .py file for the assignment.

### Portfolio Assignment 4: WordNet
* [Here](https://github.com/zachallen8/HLT_Portfolio/blob/main/Portfolio%20Assignment%204/HW4_zma180000.pdf) is the link to the .pdf for the Jupyter Notebook for the assignment.
